## ⚔️ 3️⃣ Rivalry Analysis — India vs Pakistan  

| Year Range | India Wins | Pakistan Wins | Highlight |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1984–1995 | 3 | 5 | Pakistan dominated early tournaments |
| 1996–2010 | 6 | 4 | India balanced the rivalry |
| 2011–2022 | 5 | 3 | India leads in modern era |
| **Overall** | **14** | **12** | India slightly ahead overall |

💬 *Insight:* India’s win ratio improved post-2010 as their chase efficiency increased and fielding impact grew.

## 🧩 4️⃣ Batting vs Bowling Correlation  

| Relationship | Correlation (r) | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Run Rate ↔ Win Probability | **0.61** | Strong positive correlation — higher run rate strongly linked to winning |
| Wickets Taken ↔ Win Probability | **0.47** | Moderate positive correlation |
| Extras Given ↔ Win Probability | **–0.35** | Negative correlation — more extras often lead to losses |

💡 *Higher scoring efficiency and bowling discipline directly increase win chances.*

## 🌍 5️⃣ Ground-Wise Dominance  

| Ground | Top Team | Over/Under Perf (pp) | Observation |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Sharjah (UAE)** | Pakistan | +6.5 | Strong historical record in early Asia Cups |
| **Colombo (RPS)** | Sri Lanka | +8.9 | Consistent across eras, true home advantage |
| **Mirpur (BAN)** | India | +7.2 | High success rate under pressure games |
| **Dubai (DSC)** | India | +5.0 | Dominant in recent T20 editions |

📍 *Grounds tell the story of eras — Sharjah was the past, Colombo the constant, Dubai the modern stage.*

## 📊 6️⃣ Era-Based Evolution  

| Era | Avg Run Rate | Avg Win Margin | Dominant Team | Trend |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 1984–1995 | 4.10 | 31 runs | Pakistan | Low-scoring, bowling-centric era |
| 1996–2005 | 4.80 | 45 runs | Sri Lanka | Rise of aggressive batting |
| 2006–2015 | 5.50 | 60 runs | India | Data-backed, strategic cricket |
| 2016–2022 | 6.20 | 70 runs | India | T20 influence & higher scoring consistency |

## 🧠 7️⃣ Key Learnings  

1️⃣ **Run Rate and Win %** are the most predictive indicators in this dataset.  
2️⃣ **Batting first still offers a slight edge**, but modern teams adapt better chasing.  
3️⃣ **India**’s consistency post-2010 shows data-driven improvement.  
4️⃣ **Sri Lanka** remains the most balanced and historically reliable team.  
5️⃣ **Ground effects** remain significant — neutral venues can change dynamics.
